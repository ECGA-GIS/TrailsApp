{"One The Trails":"When using this app in the field, please be sure to follow all posted signage and to respect our neighbors. While our data is frequently updated to reflect the trails on the ground, it is not 100% accurate (especially on trails not managed by Greenbelt or a partner organization). Lack of cell service will impact app performance, so it is best practice to download an offline area of your intended hiking route before leaving home. When in doubt, stay on the marked trails."}

{"Essex County Greenbelt Mission Statement":"As Essex County’s Land Trust, Greenbelt works with landowners and the thirty-four cities and towns of Essex County to conserve open space, farmland, wildlife habitat and scenic landscapes. Our work helps protect native plants, animals and natural corridors, ensure a healthy food supply, maintain clean water, and create free and accessible places for outdoor recreation and the enjoyment of nature.<br>
Greenbelt is grateful to several professional and staff photographers whose work is featured prominently within the GreenbeltGo trails app. Thank you Jerry Monkman / ecophotography.com, Lynne Holton, Kindra Clineff, Adrian Scholes and John Raleigh.<br>
Created in collaboration with Essex County Greenbelt’s GIS Team and Esri."}],"lastUpdate":"2021-05-26T12:20:00"}
