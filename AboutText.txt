While our data is frequently updated to reflect the trails on the ground, it is not 100% accurate (especially on trails not managed by Greenbelt or a partner organization). Poor cell service will impact app performance, so it is best practice to download an offline area of your intended hiking route before leaving home. When in doubt, stay on the marked trails."},{"Essex County Greenbelt Mission Statement":"As Essex County’s Land Trust, Greenbelt works with landowners and the thirty-four cities and towns of Essex County to conserve open space, farmland, wildlife habitat and scenic landscapes. Our work helps protect native plants, animals and natural corridors, ensure a healthy food supply, maintain clean water, and create free and accessible places for outdoor recreation and the enjoyment of nature."},{"Land Acknowledgement":"The properties that Greenbelt conserves are on ancestral lands of the Pennacook and the Pawtucket, bands of Abenaki-speaking people. For thousands of years, these inhabitants and their families fished, hunted, farmed, conducted ceremonies, and developed deep stewardship connections to these unceded lands and waterways. Join us in honoring the elders who lived here before, the Indigenous descendants today and the generations to come."},{"Credits":"Greenbelt is grateful to several professional and staff photographers whose work is featured prominently within the GreenbeltGo trails app. Thank you Jerry Monkman / ecophotography.com, Lynne Holton, Neil Ungerleider, Kindra Clineff, Adrian Scholes and John Raleigh.<br><br>Special thanks to Allegheny County’s GIS Team.<br><br>Created in collaboration with Essex County Greenbelt’s GIS Team and Esri."}],"lastUpdate":"2022-09-21T12:02:00"}
